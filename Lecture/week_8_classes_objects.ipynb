    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "What is encapsulation in OOP (object-oriented programming)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation means bundling together data and the methods for working with this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It may also refer to the process of restricting access to methods and variables in a class in order to prevent direct data modification so it prevents accidental data modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Control: Encapsulation provides control over the data by allowing you to restrict or permit data modification only through methods.\n",
    "* Flexibility & Maintenance: Since the internal representation of an object is hidden, it can be changed without affecting the external interface of the object. This is useful in maintaining and updating software.\n",
    "* Increased Security: Protects the integrity of the data by only allowing it to be changed in well-defined ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, encapsulation is achieved by declaring class variables/attributes as private and providing public get and set methods to modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we do not really have private attributes and methods but there is a naming convention that attributes and methods denoted using underscore prefix, for example `_name`, are considered \"private\" and should not be used directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use double underscore as the prefix, for example `__name`. This is called name mangling and it is used to prevent accidental access of private variables. Python interpreter changes the name of the variable from `__name` to `_classname__name` thus making it more difficult to access.\n"

    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is another core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). Derived from the Greek words \"poly\" (many) and \"morph\" (forms), polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class.\n",

    "The essence of polymorphism is providing a single interface for working with entities of different types.\n",

    "##### Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flexibility: Polymorphism provides flexibility in using pre-defined methods across different types or classes.\n",
    "* Reusability: Common interfaces can be reused for objects of different types.\n",
    "* Extensibility: New classes can be added with little or no modification to existing code, promoting the Open/Closed Principle.\n",

    "\n",
    "Composability in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to the design principle where simple objects are combined to create more complex ones. Rather than defining a monolithic structure that tries to capture every aspect of a problem domain, composability focuses on building smaller, simpler objects that can be combined in flexible ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, this often means favoring composition over inheritance. While inheritance allows a new class to be derived from an existing one, sometimes it can lead to complex class hierarchies that are hard to understand, maintain, or modify. On the other hand, composition involves building classes by combining simpler, already-existing objects. This approach is more flexible and easier to understand.\n",
